INSTALLING COB2SAS ON MVS

Now that you've downloaded the COB2SAS8.ZIP file and unzipped it,
follow the following instructions to install COB2SAS on MVS :

1) On MVS, allocate a PDS with the following characteristics :

     SPACE=(6160,(220,20,7)),
     DCB=(DSORG=PO,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=6160,RECFM=FB)

2) Transfer all of the files, except for the HTML files, into this new
   PDS.  There is no need to upload the HTML files.  Use the PC
   filename for the PDS member name dropping the extension.  Use FTP
   or any other file transfer utility to move the files to MVS.  Allow
   the ASCII to EBCDIC translation to occur in the upload (i.e. do NOT
   do a binary upload)!

3) Verify your COB2SAS installation.  To run COB2SAS use either the
   MVSBATCH member or the MVSDMS member.  MVSBATCH contains the JCL to
   execute COB2SAS in batch.  MVSDMS contains the statement you would
   use to submit COB2SAS in interactive mode (or in a SAS/CONNECT
   environment connecting to MVS).

   Using one of these programs make the necessary modifications to the
   FILENAME statement / DD Names as per the comments.  Point the
   INCOBOL fileref/DDName to the CP1 member and run the program.

   When the job completes, make sure you didn't get any ERRORS in the
   SASLOG.

   If you didn't receive any errors, then compare the output in the
   OUTSAS fileref/DDname to the contents of the CP1LOG member.

   If the contents of OUTSAS matches the contents of CP1LOG, then
   compare the output in your SASLIST (or output window) to the
   contents of the CP1LST member.

   If everything matched up and you got no errors, then you're all
   set.

   If something didn't match, or if you got errors in your SASLOG,
   then verify that you did everything correctly.  If so, then change
   the options statement to include SOURCE and SOURCE2 options, rerun
   the program, and contact the SAS Technical Support department at
   919-677-8008 or send E-mail to support@sas.com.


After you've verified your COB2SAS installation, you can use the same
programs (MVSBATCH & MVSDMS) to execute COB2SAS.
