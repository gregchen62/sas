 ***  Purpose of COB2SAS, Release 2


 COB2SAS, Release 2 is a tool that can assist you in converting COBOL
 language data description entries into equivalent SAS(R) language
 statements.


 *** Overview of COB2SAS, Release 2


 COB2SAS, Release 2 uses the information in the data description
 entries of COBOL language programs to create a data dictionary.
 Succeeding steps use this data dictionary to create SAS language
 statements equivalent to the data descriptions entries.


 *** Highlights of COB2SAS, Release 2


 * It processes COBOL data description entries appearing in either
   complete programs or in copy members.

 * It is able to process several COBOL programs in a single
   execution.

 * It employs a parsing algorithm that is based upon the definition
   of COBOL in ANSI specification X3.23-1985.

 * It creates a data dictionary which is similar to the ones created
   when compiling with various MAP options of the COBOL compiler.

 * It is designed to allow you to create your own programs that
   reconcile differing conventions between the COBOL and SAS
   languages.

 * Included with COB2SAS, Release 2 is a sample program that
   compresses the lengths of variable names to no more than 8
   characters.

 * It is written in the SAS language.

 * It executes under Version 5 and Version 6 of the SAS System under
   CMS, MVS, VMS(TM) and VSE.
