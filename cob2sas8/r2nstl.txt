 * Media on which COB2SAS, Release 2 is distributed


 COB2SAS, Release 2 is available on several different media.

    * For the CMS, MVS and VSE operating systems, it is distributed
      on either 9 track tape or IBM 3480 cartridge. This tape has
      volser OCCOB2.

    * For the VMS operating system, it is distributed on either
      9 track tape or TK 50 cartridge. This tape has volser VMCOB2.

    * It is also available on either  5.25 inch high density
      diskette  or  3.5 inch high density diskette.

 Regardless of the media on which it is distributed or the operating
 system on which it is installed, the contents of all of the files
 are identical.


 * Installing COB2SAS, Release 2 from diskette

    If you receive COB2SAS, Release 2 on diskette, you will need to
 transfer the files on the diskette to your host computing system.
 However, before transferring these files to your host computing
 system, refer to the section of this guide that discusses installing
 COB2SAS, Release 2 on your operating system. This section explains
 how the programs should be installed on your operating system.

    Since you are installing COB2SAS, Release 2 from diskette,
 ignore the instructions that refer to mounting and installing from
 the mailer tape. The instructions that refer to mounting and
 installing from the mailer tape, assume that you have received
 either a tape or cartridge.


 * Important notes about the test program

    After installing COB2SAS, Release 2, you may want to execute
 the test program shown later in this guide. If you choose to do
 so, there is no need for you to type in a copy of the test program
 yourself. Since a copy of these installation instructions is in the
 file R2NSTL, you can get a copy of the test program from R2NSTL.

    Since the listing produced by the test program is created by
 PROC PRINT, it is possible that the format of your listing and the
 listing in CP1LST will be slightly different. If output is produced
 and the values in that output match those in CP1LST, then the test
 is successful.






 COB2SAS, Release 2 Install Guide                        Page  1


 * Installing under CMS

 The R2CMS program refers to the other programs as if they are
 members of a MACLIB called COB2SAS. For this reason, the programs
 must be installed in a CMS MACLIB called COB2SAS.

 You will need a total of 210 blocks of minidisk space, formatted at
 4096 bytes per block, to install the COB2SAS MACLIB and test data
 sets.

 The COB2SAS, Release 2 mailer tape has a volser of OCCOB2. After
 mounting the mailer tape at virtual address 181, use the following
 commands to load the COB2SAS MACLIB and test data sets.


    VMFPLC2 REW
    VMFPLC2 FSF 3
    VMFPLC2 LOAD * * fm

    where fm is the filemode of the receiving minidisk.



































 COB2SAS, Release 2 Install Guide                        Page  2


 * Testing under CMS

 If you want to verify that COB2SAS, Release 2 is properly installed,
 submit the following program to the SAS System. The SAS System must
 be invoked with the SAS System options, MACRO and DQUOTE, in order
 for COB2SAS, Release 2 to work properly.

 Refer to Page 2 of this document for important notes about the test
 program.


    OPTIONS NONOTES NOSOURCE NOSOURCE2;
    X FILEDEF INCOBOL DISK CP1 COBOL fm;
    RUN;

    %INCLUDE COB2SAS(R2CMS);
    RUN;

    PROC PRINT DATA=DICTNRY;
       BY FILENAME NOTSORTED;
       FORMAT RDF_NAME $8.;
       ID LEVEL;
       VAR NST_DPTH NEWNAME USAGE PICTURE INFMT ATBYTE BYTES
           OCR_VAL RDF_NAME;
    RUN;

    where fm is the filemode of the minidisk with the test data sets.

 Compare the SAS Log and Listing files with the results provided in
 data sets:

    CP1LOG LOG fm
    CP1LST LISTING fm

    where fm is the filemode of the minidisk on which they reside.



 NOTE: If you encounter difficulties with this job, you can, if you
       wish, use the MACLIST command to inspect the COB2SAS MACLIB.
       MACLIST (which is a CMS command) is a convenient facility for
       inspecting MACLIB's.

       Also, since the R2CMS member of the COB2SAS MACLIB is included
       from that MACLIB for execution, be sure to have no other files
       with the name COB2SAS on or ahead of the minidisk with the
       COB2SAS MACLIB.

 * Installing under MVS

 The R2MVS program refers to the other programs as if they are
 members of a partitioned data set referenced with ddname COB2SAS.
 For this reason, the programs must be installed in a partitioned
 data set and any jobs that make use of the R2MVS program to execute
 COB2SAS must refer to this PDS with ddname COB2SAS.

 The PDS in which the COB2SAS programs are installed must have DCB
 characteristics, LRECL 80 and RECFM FB. The suggested name for this
 PDS is 'COB2SAS.PROGRAMS', however this name is not a requirement.

 The COB2SAS, Release 2 mailer tape has a volser of OCCOB2.

 Use the following JCL to create and load the COB2SAS PDS.

 Any lines that you must edit are denoted by, ' <== VERIFY'.

 * Installing under VMS

 The R2VMS program refers to the other programs as if they are
 members of the VMS directory 'SAS$ROOT:<SAMPLES.BASE.COB2SAS>'.
 For this reason, you must either install the programs in the VMS
 directory 'SAS$ROOT:<SAMPLES.BASE.COB2SAS>', or install the programs
 in some other directory and modify the R2VMS program to reference
 the directory in which you install the COB2SAS programs.

 You will need a total of 1740 blocks of free space, on your disk,
 to install the COB2SAS programs and test data sets.

 To install COB2SAS, Release 2, logon with a system account or an
 account that has the privilege to write to the directory in which
 the SAS System is installed and follow these instructions:


    Create the COB2SAS directory with the command:
       $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SAS$ROOT:<SAMPLES.BASE.COB2SAS>

       where SAS$ROOT is a logical that references the directory
       in which the SAS System is installed.


    The COB2SAS, Release 2 mailer tape has a volser of VMCOB2.
    Make the tape drive available to your process with the commands:
       $ ALLOC tapedevicename TAPE
       $ MOUNT/FOREIGN TAPE

       where tapedevicename is the name of your tape drive.


    Load the COB2SAS directory with the programs and test data sets:
       $ BACKUP/LOG TAPE:COB2SAS.BCK  -
       _$ SAS$ROOT:<SAMPLES.BASE.COB2SAS>/OWNER=PARENT


    Detach the tape drive from your process:
       $ DISMOUNT TAPE
       $ DEALLOC TAPE















 COB2SAS, Release 2 Install Guide                        Page  6


 * Testing under VMS

 If you want to verify that COB2SAS, Release 2 is properly installed,
 submit the following program to the SAS System.

 If you are executing under Version 6 of the SAS System, then the SAS
 System must be invoked with the SAS System option, MACRO, in order
 for COB2SAS, Release 2 to work properly.

 Refer to Page 2 of this document for important notes about the test
 program.

 * Installing under VSE

 The R2VSE program refers to the other programs as if they are
 installed in a VSE LIBRARY. For this reason, the programs must
 be installed in a VSE LIBRARY.

 To install COB2SAS, Release 2, create a VSE LIBRARY in VSAM managed
 space and use the LIBRARIAN utility to restore the COB2SAS.PROGRAMS
 LIBRARY as explained in the following instructions.


 Use the appropriate IDCAMS commands to allocate VSAM space for the
 VSE LIBRARY. To get space requirements, use the following table.


   Device    Tracks  º Device    Tracks  º Device    Tracks
    Type    Required º  Type    Required º  Type    Required
                     º                   º
                     º  3340       43    º  3375       11
    3330       28    º  3350       20    º  3380        9

   For an FBA device, 420 Blocks are required.


 The COB2SAS, Release 2 mailer tape has a volser of OCCOB2.

 Use the following JCL to restore the COB2SAS LIBRARY.
