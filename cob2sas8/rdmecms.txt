INSTALLING COB2SAS ON CMS

Now that you've downloaded the COB2SAS8.ZIP file and unzipped it,
follow the following instructions to install COB2SAS on CMS :

1) Transfer all of the files, except for the HTML files, to your CMS
   minidisk.  There's no need to transfer the HTML files.  For the CMS
   filename, use the PC filename without the extension.  For filetype,
   use COPY.  Use FTP or any other file transfer utility to move the
   files to CMS.  Allow the ASCII to EBCDIC translation to occur in
   the upload (i.e. do NOT do a binary upload)!  Be sure that every
   CMS file is fixed record length with an LRECL of 80.

2) Move the uploaded files into a MACLIB called COB2SAS.  Following is an
   example of the syntax you would use to do this :

     MACLIB GEN COB2SAS filename1 filename2 ... filenameN

   * If by some chance, you can't use COB2SAS as your maclib name,
     then you'll have to make modifications to the CMSDMS and R2CMS
     files.  In this case, edit the CMSDMS and the R2CMS files
     changing the following line :

       %INCLUDE COB2SAS(xxxxx)

     .. where xxxx is any program name ..

       to %INCLUDE yourmaclibname(xxxxx)

3) Verify your COB2SAS installation.  To run COB2SAS use the CMSDMS
   program.  Make the necessary modifications to the FILENAME
   statements as per the comments.  Point the INCOBOL fileref to the
   CP1 file and run the program.

   When the job completes, make sure you didn't get any ERRORS in the
   SASLOG.

   If you didn't receive any errors, then compare the output in the
   OUTSAS file to the contents of the CP1LOG file.

   If the contents of OUTSAS matches the contents of CP1LOG, then
   compare the output in your SASLIST (or output window) to the
   contents of the CP1LST file.

   If everything matched up and you got no errors, then you're all
   set.

   If something didn't match, or if you got errors in your SASLOG,
   then verify that you did everything correctly.  If so, then change
   the options statement to include SOURCE and SOURCE2 options, rerun
   the program, and contact the SAS Technical Support department at
   919-677-8008 or send E-mail to support@sas.com.

After you've verified your COB2SAS installation, you can use the
CMSDMS program to execute COB2SAS.
