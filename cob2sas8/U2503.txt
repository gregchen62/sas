TITLE:      SAS informats that correspond to COBOL data descriptions


 When asked which SAS informat corresponds to a COBOL data description,
 ask for the PICTURE and USAGE. (If the USAGE is COMP-1 or COMP-2, then
 there is no PICTURE.) Use the following to make the conversion:

    Pictures that have either A or X in them represent character values
    Pictures that represent numbers use 9 to represent digits and may
    use an S to mean signed and a V to show the location of an implied
    decimal point.

 The number of characters or digits is specified either by the number
 of A's, X's, or 9's in the picture or by the number in parentheses
 immediately after the A, X, or 9  (ex. AAAA is the same as A(4)).

 USAGE      PICTURE           INFORMAT   width                 decimal
 -----      -------           --------   -----                 -------
 COMP-1     NONE              RB4.
 COMP-2     NONE              RB8.
 DISPLAY    9(int)V9(fract)   ZD         (int + fract)         (fract)
 COMP-3     9(int)V9(fract)   PD    CEIL((int + fract + 1)/2)  (fract)
 COMP       9(int)V9(fract)   IB           see following table
    If  1 <= (int + fract) <=  4, width is 2 and decimal is fract.
    If  5 <= (int + fract) <=  9, width is 4 and decimal is fract.
    If 10 <= (int + fract) <= 18, width is 8 and decimal is fract.
